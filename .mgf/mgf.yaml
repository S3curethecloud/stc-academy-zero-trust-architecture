    After identity is verified and compute is securely placed, how do we
    continuously decide whether access should persist?

  canonical_definition: >
    Phase 3 — Zero Trust Architecture defines how trust is continuously
    evaluated and enforced after access is granted. Zero Trust is treated
    as an architectural control system layered on top of identity
    (Phase 1) and secure compute placement (Phase 2), using identity,
    policy, context, network intent, and telemetry.

architectural_pillars:
  - id: identity_control_plane
    name: "Identity as the Control Plane"
    depends_on: "Phase 1 — Identity Foundations"
    description: >
      Identity replaces network location as the primary trust signal.
      Authentication does not equal authorization. Access is session-based
      and short-lived.

  - id: no_implicit_network_trust
    name: "No Implicit Network Trust"
    depends_on: "Phase 2 — Secure Compute Foundations"
    description: >
      Network location provides zero trust. East–west traffic must be
      explicitly approved and lateral movement is denied by default.

  - id: policy_driven_access
    name: "Policy-Driven Least Privilege"
    description: >
      Access is governed by intent, not convenience. Policies define who,
      what, when, and how access occurs.

  - id: conditional_trust
    name: "Context & Conditional Trust"
    description: >
      Trust is dynamic and conditional. Authorization decisions change
      based on identity state, context, and risk.

  - id: telemetry_enforcement
    name: "Telemetry-Driven Enforcement"
    prepares_for: "Phase 4 — Detection & Response (SIEM)"
    description: >
      Telemetry is an active enforcement input. Trust can be reduced or
      revoked at any time based on signals.
